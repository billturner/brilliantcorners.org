I'll keep this short: I've yet again relaunched the weblog using yet other kind of weblog software. There are several not-so-well thought out reasons for changing everything again, but the main ones are:

1. Since I didn't write this software, I won't be _too_ tempted to rewrite it
2. I have other ideas I'd rather be working on instead of rewriting weblog software (which I seem to have a problem with)
3. [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll "The Jekyll weblog software on Github") generates static files, which should lessen the load on my VPS

This one should hold me over for long enough. At least long enough to write another post.
