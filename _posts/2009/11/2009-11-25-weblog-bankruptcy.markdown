Well, I did it. I killed the old weblog.

I didn't just change weblog software (although I did do that, too), but I'm getting rid of all the old posts. Half of them are outdated and the rest were sort of useless. It want to start somewhat fresh again.

In a few days, I'll have something a little more substantive on the big switch. Until then, welcome to the new brilliantcorners.org!
