A couple of days ago, I came across this blog post called ["Drawing as a Programmer"](http://gameofworlds.tumblr.com/post/76836176462/drawing-as-a-programmer "Drawing as a Programmer post") and it struck a chord with me, both as a programmer, and as someone trying to draw and sketch more. The author talks about how taking short breaks for drawing can help with refocusing:

> I started sketching again. At first I did it after job hours, in my spare time, but then I noticed that, after acquiring some basic knack, I can draw simple sketches quickly, so I tried to have drawing breaks when I got stuck with a new coding problem in my head. And to my surprise, my productivity rose.

> Every software engineer worth a dime knows that programming is more about thinking, than typing code (and if you do not agree, you should probably go do copywriting or something). When you work on a hard problem, you think, think, think, read an article on your current topic, think, maybe do some tinkering here and there, think again, get an ‘AHA’ moment, and then, only then do typing.

That's so very true. Many times I need some time to think out a problem; I need to focus on something else while my mind clears so perhaps I can think of another approach. I'm going to give this a shot and see if it works in those times I'm stuck.
