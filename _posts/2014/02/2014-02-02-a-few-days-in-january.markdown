I started out this year sketching every day, even if it was just something simple and around the house. That lasted just over a week. Sigh. But, I have picked it up a few times since then, and I do plan on being a little better about sketching this year. I'd like to experiment a bit more with watercolors as well.

One thing that should hopefully help with this task is Danny Gregory and friends' [Sketchbook Skool](http://www.sketchbookskool.com/ "The official website for Sketchbook Skool"). I've signed up for the first "semester," and I'm quite looking forward to it. I'm familiar with the work of [all of the instructors](http://www.sketchbookskool.com/#!fakulty/c16o0 "List of instructors for first semester of Sketchbook Skool") he has lined up. Here's hoping it'll go well.

The two pages from the sketchbook at the top of the post were from that initial week-long bout of sketching in January. The painting was inspired from looking out the back window at a particularly colorful sunset.
