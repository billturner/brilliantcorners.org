If you're reading this post, then you're at my weblog's new home. I've owned the kindofblue.com domain since 1997, but haven't really used it for anything since the early 2000s. So, I'm bringing it back to life as the new home for my weblog. In a few weeks, I'll explain where brilliantcorners.org is going. But that will have to wait.

Now, that we've changed domains, I'll probably give the styling of the site a bit of a refresh, but for now, it'll still look like the old one.

Here's to something new in a new year!
