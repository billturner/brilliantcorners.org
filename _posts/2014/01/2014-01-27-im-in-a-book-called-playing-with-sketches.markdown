A new art instruction book by Whitney Sherman called [_Playing with Sketches_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592538614/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1592538614&linkCode=as2&tag=billturner "Playing with Sketches on Amazon.com") contains a couple of quotes of mine, and references [The Tools Artists Use](http://thetoolsartistsuse.com/ "The Tools Artists Use weblog"). I knew the site would be mentioned, but not to what extent. I also wasn't sure if there was going to be any mention of me at all. I had assumed a small mention of the site and that was it. I'm quite happily surprised!

Here's a (blurry) screenshot of the page:

You can see a little more of the inside of the book at [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592538614/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1592538614&linkCode=as2&tag=billturner "Playing with Sketches on Amazon.com"), and I go into a little more detail [in a post over on The Tools Artist Use](http://thetoolsartistsuse.com/2014/01/wonderful-mention-in-playing-with-sketches-book/ "A post on The Tools Artists Use mentioning the mention in the book.").
