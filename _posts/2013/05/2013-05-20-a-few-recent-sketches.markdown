I've been doing quite a bit better about finding a bit of time here and there for sketching or painting. My last Moleskine sketchbook took about four years to fill; my current one will be filled within a single year.

I've also been trying to add a bit of color with some watercolor paints. I'm still learning how best to handle the color, but I'll get there. Here are the sketches:

And I've uploaded a few other sketches, and should continue to do so, [up on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/billturner/sets/72157633106594802/).
