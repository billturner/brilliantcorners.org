[Cartoonist Bob Flynn posted some of his thoughts](http://bobjinx.blogspot.com/2013/05/thoughts-on-freehand-doodling.html "The doodling post on Bob Flynn's weblog") on how important doodling (and sketching) is for development as an artist. The mantra to "keep practicing" is there, but he definitely goes a little deeper than that:

> Where I think doodling is important has more to do with discovery. Trying things. Messing around. The more you do it, the more familiar you are with how you draw in general. The more spontaneous your ideas will be. It puts you in touch with your imagination. And it frees you up from that pressure of making mistakes. Because who cares if you make a mistake? Work with it! And if you make a bad drawing, there's still plenty more room in your sketchbook to make good drawings.

And then he talks about why he uses a pen or other permanent medium to sketch:

> You don't have to doodle with a pen, brush, or marker, but I do think the permanence of ink switches that planning thing off in your brain. 

I'm not sure if that's the same reason I mainly stick to sketching directly in pen or not, but I do think using a pen has helped me improve. I must subconsciously realize how permanent the marks will be, so I'll be a little more careful while sketching. I also like the feel of a pen (either my fountain pen, or something else) in my hand, more so than a pencil.

As a side note, I [interviewed Bob several years ago](http://thetoolsartistsuse.com/2009/08/bob-flynn/ "Bob Flynn's interview") for [The Tools Artists Use](http://thetoolsartistsuse.com/ "The Tools Artists Use homepage"). And he puts out [a great comic (called Heeby Jeeby Comix)](http://heebyjeebycomix.blogspot.com/) with some friends. I highly recommend it!
