There is a local "plein air" group that's starting to meet the first Saturday of every month, and this morning was the first get together. While the other two artists that showed up and painted pulled out big easels and paint sets, I had only my Moleskine notebook, a few pencils, my favorite pen, and a small watercolor set.

I'm glad the someone has started up the group, and if we keep meeting in the Uptown part of Mt. Lebanon, I'll definitely continue going. I'm quite please with the resulting sketch (with a few touches of watercolor):
