Since I [last mentioned](http://brilliantcorners.org/2012/07/reviving-a-favorite-project "My previous entry about bringing The Tools Artists Use back to life") bringing [The Tools Artists Use](http://thetoolsartistsuse.com/ "The Tools Artists Use homepage") back to life, I've added _24_ new interviews! I'll admit that I was a little unsure if I was going to be able to keep it going, but I've been doing pretty well at posting [new interviews](http://thetoolsartistsuse.com/all-interviews/ "A link to all interviews posted on the site, with newest ones at the top") fairly regularly. To demonstrate my dedication to the site, I've even put together a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/TheToolsArtistsUse "The Facebook page for The Tools Artists Use") for it.

I'm happy to have been able to put up interviews with several artists I've admired for many years, and many more with artists that I've become recent fans of. I have interview #25 all lined up and ready for posting in a couple of days, and here's hoping there are still many more to come.
