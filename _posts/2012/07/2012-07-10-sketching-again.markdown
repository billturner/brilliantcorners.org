One of the primary reasons for bringing this weblog back to life was to start sharing some of my sketches. Of all the hobbies I've had throughout my life, sketching is one that I've particularly enjoyed.

Unfortunately, the actual practice of sketching would go in spurts. I'd go strong for a couple of months, only then to not touch a sketchbook for months (and sometimes years). But in the last year or so, I've been making a effort to practice more. I want to be better at putting what I see down on paper.

Now, on to the sharing. Here's today's practice, from the [Everyday Matters challenge list of things to draw](http://dannygregory.wordpress.com/edm-challenges/):
