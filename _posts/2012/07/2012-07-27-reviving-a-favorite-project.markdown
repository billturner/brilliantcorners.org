Right about the time I started my current job, I put a project I started a couple of years before on hold. Instead of just taking a break while I acclimated myself to my new job, I let the project sit and gather dust. I would think about it every couple of months, and before I knew it, two years had passed. Now, after a couple of weeks of late nights spent working, I'm just about ready to bring it back from the dead.

I'm happy to say that I'm going to start posting artist interviews over at [The Tools Artists Use](http://thetoolsartistsuse.com/) again. It may be a week or so before I get a new interview ready, but I've started sending out interview requests already. And since I'm considerably more busy now, I probably won't be able to post as often as I used to. But at least it's coming back.

And now that [I'm starting to pick up sketching again](http://brilliantcorners.org/2012/07/sketching-again), it'll be nice to have a resource for more art supplies ideas (that I probably don't need, but will buy anyway).
