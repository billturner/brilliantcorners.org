As I begin to dust things off to start posting again, I thought I'd clean up all the RSS feed links that I've used over the years, and just consolidate them into a single place. For a long while, I was using [FeedBurner](http://feedburner.google.com/) as a feed masher by taking the blog posts here and adding in any [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/billturner) photos I happen to post. But, since I don't use Flickr for much these days (other than an Instagram dumping ground), I figured I'd take the photos out. So, why use that service at all then, right?

Pretty soon I'm going to remove the FeedBurner feed and from now on just use a single location for the feed: [kindofblue.com/rss.xml](http://kindofblue.com/rss.xml). It's also linked to in the sidebar.

If you're not directly subscribed to that RSS URL above, then at some point you may stop getting updates. I think I can set up FeedBurner to redirect any stragglers, but I don't think it's permanent.

And for those still subscribed by any means, thanks for sticking around. More is coming.
