This last Wednesday, I finally posted another interview on [The Tools Artists Use](http://thetoolsartistsuse.com/), after letting it sit unloved for over two years. And I couldn't have asked for a better interviewee than [Tommy Kane](http://thetoolsartistsuse.com/2012/08/tommy-kane/) to start things up again. I've been a huge fan of his work for years, and I was overjoyed that he agreed to an interview. I've received replies and confirmations from many other wonderful artists, so I should have a fairly steady supply of interviews for months to come. I'm really glad I got the site up and running again.

Below is a sketch of another one of the [Everyday Matters challenges](http://dannygregory.wordpress.com/edm-challenges/). I'm not going through them an any sort of order, and the reason I chose this one is because it was easy to complete while I was sitting in my son's guitar lesson. Although I do get better and better working directly with ink, I've found that a light pencil outline ahead of time can make things look a _lot_ better as I sketch.
