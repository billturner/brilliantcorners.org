A list of books I've recently read, or re-read, that have helped me get the pen and pencil to paper and sketching again.

* _[Everyday Matters](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401307957/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1401307957&linkCode=as2&tag=billturner)_, by Danny Gregory
  > Danny Gregory writes about how sketching was one of the things he turned to as a release when his wife became paralyzed after an accident. It's a moving and inspirational memoir.
* _[The Creative License](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401307922/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1401307922&linkCode=as2&tag=billturner)_, also by Danny Gregory
  > Here Danny Gregory offers plenty of creative and inspirational advice for those wanting to start sketching themselves. The book's subtitle, "Giving Yourself Permission to Be The Artist You Truly Are," says it all.
* _[An Illustrated Life](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600610862/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1600610862&linkCode=as2&tag=billturner)_, edited by Danny Gregory
  > This book, that looks through the illustrated journals of many artists, was the first of Danny's books that I bought. And since it also points out the tools the participants use, it started my obsession with all kinds of artists tools, and what spurred the creation of [The Tools Artists Use](http://thetoolsartistsuse.com/).
* _[The Art of Urban Sketching](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592537251/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1592537251&linkCode=as2&tag=billturner)_, editied by Gabriel Campanario
  > This book is a recent analog companion to the wonderful [Urban Sketchers](http://urbansketchers.org/) blog. I've been following the blog for many years, but I was overjoyed to receive this book as a gift, as it gives me an easy way to browse through some of my favorite sketches and artists from the blog.
* _[Artist's Journal Workshop](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1440308683/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1440308683&linkCode=as2&tag=billturner)_, by Cathy Johnson
  > This is my most recent book, and it was hard to put it down. I don't think I'll ever do a true "journal" with lots of writing along with my sketches, but the lessons and inspiration are still quite relevant.
* _[What It Is](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1897299354/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1897299354&linkCode=as2&tag=billturner)_, by Lynda Barry
  > This is actually meant to help spur creativity and inspiration for writing, but it does just fine for creating art as well. The life stories intermixed with mythology and creativity-boosting tips are wonderful. And you can't beat the lovely collages, making every page a work of art. Lynda Barry has another book meant for artistic inspiration, called [Picture This](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1897299648/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1897299648&linkCode=as2&tag=billturner), but I liked this one much better.
* _[Steal Like an Artist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761169253/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0761169253&linkCode=as2&tag=billturner)_, by Austin Kleon
  > A short collection of inspiring quotes and mantras for creating your own voice, whether you're an artist, a musician, or writer.

I'm sure there are more, but these are the ones that have made the biggest impression on me, or that I'll occasionally pick up and flip through.
