**About Me**

I am a father, a husband, a developer, and a Texan living in Pittsburgh, PA. I'm currently employed as a Ruby on Rails application developer by the nice folks at [CloudPassage](http://cloudpassage.com/). We're doing some really neat stuff with cloud server security. Check us out!

**About the site**

The current version of this weblog is built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). The source for any custom site code and the posts resides [in a repository on GitHub](https://github.com/billturner/brilliantcorners.org). Previous incarnations have used [Greymatter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greymatter_\(software\)), [Drupal](http://drupal.org/), [Blogger](http://blogger.com/), [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/), [Bloxsom](http://www.blosxom.com/), and various home-rolled implementations written in Perl, Merb, Sinatra, and Ruby on Rails (not necessarily in that order).

The name, Kind of Blue, comes from the [Miles Davis album](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002ADT/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000002ADT&linkCode=as2&tag=billturner "Buy this wonderful album, via Amazon.com") of the same name. Other than being named after the album, there is no specific meaning behind the name.
