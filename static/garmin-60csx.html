           <h2 class="title">Fixing a dead Garmin GPSMap 60CSx</h2>
     <div class="post-content">
                 <p>One of my favorite gifts that I received this last Christmas has been my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSOXTO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=billturner&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000CSOXTO">Garmin GPSMap 60CSx</a> GPS receiver (GPSr). Now that the weather has been getting better, I&#8217;ve been itching to use it to start tracking my bike rides (which I can later plot on a map). So, to get ready, I started up Parallels, connected the GPSr, and updated the firmware (mainly to get the update to correct the new daylight savings time).</p>

<p>Everything seemed to go just fine when running the WebUpdater application, until a small note on the last message box during the update process. There was something there about a problem with the update, but the message box had a &#8220;Finish&#8221; button, so I blew it off as something I probably didn&#8217;t need to worry about. But I did need to worry. Once I disconnected the unit, it wouldn&#8217;t start up. At all. I got a flash of some kind of info screen, but it immediately went blank again. Nothing. Dead. I tried to run the firmware updating software again, only for it to not even find the GPSr, even though it was plugged in. Great.</p>

<p>I hopped online to see if I could find any information about this problem. In the excellent <a href="http://forums.groundspeak.com/gc/">Groundspeak geocaching forums</a> I read some similar reports, but all the tips the suggested to get the GPSr working again didn&#8217;t work for me. Many said they ended up having to send in theirs in to Garmin to get fixed. I didn&#8217;t want to do that.</p>

<p>A few folks in the forum suggested to others that they call Garmin&#8217;s customer support, and that they were nice and quite helpful. So I did, and after some back and forth and checking with other support staff, the friendly chap at Garmin support helped me fix my GPSr <em>without</em> having to send it in. Yay!</p>

<p>So, ANYWAY, here&#8217;s the point of this post: here&#8217;s one way to revive your dead Garmin GPSMap 60CSx:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the latest firmware file from <a href="http://www.gpsinformation.org/perry/gps60/">this handy site</a>. The filename will look like this: GPSMAP60CSx_330.exe (where the 330 is the firmware version number).</li>

<li>Double click the .exe (which is a self-extracting archive) and it will ask you where you want to extract the files (the default is c:\garmin). If you have your other Garmin applications (like MapSource) already installed in c:\garmin, then choose another location to extract the files.</li>
<li>Now, here&#8217;s where it gets tricky. Since the unit wasn&#8217;t recognized by the firmware updater on its own, customer support gave me the crazy keypad combination to trick the updater to see your USB GPSr: <strong>hold down the power button (on the top of the unit) and push the directional button in the up (&#8220;^&#8221;) position.</strong></li>
<li>While holding those buttons down, double click on the Updater.exe file in the directory where the firmware updates were extracted to.</li>
<li>If this worked for you, then your GPSr <em>should</em> now show up for the firmware update program. While <strong>still</strong> holding down the two buttons, make sure your GPS device is selected, and then click the &#8220;OK&#8221; button to start the firmware update.</li>

<li>During the entire firmware update process you need to hold those buttons down. The update can take several minutes, and your fingers will start to HURT, but you need to hold them down.</li>
<li>Once the update has completed, you can relax your fingers and you should now be able to start up your GPSr.</li>
<li>Jump for joy!</li>
</ol>

<p>This post is probably too long for such a simple fix, but if all this rambling helps someone out there, then it was worth it. I&#8217;m glad I have my updated 60CSx and that I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> have to send it back to Garmin.</p>

         <p>Thanks for the fix, but it doesn&#8217;t work for me.  Same/similar setup: Garmin 60CSx, Parallels latest version with WinXP VM, MacBook Pro Core 2 Duo running 10.4.9.</p>

<p>I did a firmware update using the web updater. The update ran through to completion, I saw the &#8220;Loader&#8221; screen, &amp;c. on the GPS, then I got a <em>successful</em> completion message on the updater program under Windows, but the GPS went blank, and won&#8217;t power on.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried removing batteries and replacing with new (the &#8220;old&#8221; ones were almost-new), reboots, you name it.</p>

<p>I really was hopeful your trick would work for me, but alas, the GPS won&#8217;t show up under USB.</p>

<p>Sigh. I supposed this means I have to pay to have it fixed.  According to the Garmin web site, they won&#8217;t warranty failed firmware updates.</p>

<p>What really frustrates me, is I&#8217;m a software engineer for a large printer company, and I design and implement the firmware update system for the printers among other jobs.  One key requirement is that the flash update must <em>always</em> fail into a user-recoverable mode for the system.  We use several methods &#8212; such as copying all the flash image data into RAM and CRC&#8217;ing it before we write a single byte into flash memory.  That way, even if communication is lost during data transfer, the device just reboots and no harm done.  Once flash write starts, all the I/O ports and protocols are disabled, along with all control buttons, so really only removing power during the write phaser could cause an incorrect flash image.  But even that wouldn&#8217;t toast the box.</p>

<p>We also break the flash into several regions.  There&#8217;s a tiny, tiny boot loader that never gets overwritten, and it looks in two different places for the main boot loader, using an NVRAM bit to determine which is &#8220;preferred&#8221;, but it will CRC it before loading it and fail to the other location.</p>

<p>The flash update program only overwrites the &#8220;old&#8221; bootloader, so there&#8217;s always one which has enough smarts to run USB and a flash loader.</p>

<p>I guess Garmin hasn&#8217;t figured this all out yet.  Maybe they should hire me to consult. :-/</p>

         <p>Kevin,</p>

<p>That truly sucks. Perhaps I was just lucky in that the crazy contortionist keypad update worked for me.</p>

<p>Before assuming you&#8217;ll have to pay for them fixing it, give their customer support number a call. They were super helpful and they <em>may</em> let you send it in without having to pay for the fix.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;ve noticed that Garmin has released a Mac version of the WebUpdater, which you can download <a href="http://www8.garmin.com/support/collection.jsp?product=999-99999-27">here</a>. Who knows how it works, though.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

We weren&#8217;t about to send it back to Garmin to have them charge us to fix a problem with their updater software. The unit was packaged up to be returned to the reseller when I did one last websearch for a cure. Found your description of the problem (exactly what happened to us), and the instructions worked perfectly. Thank you again.</p>

         <p>Bill,</p>

<p>I&#8217;m enthused to run across your article while searching for any info on Macs working with Garmin.  I seem to have killed off my well-weathered GPSMap 60C in the same manner while connecting through Parallels.  Contacted Garmin support and they suggested I could reset by clearing out the system or send them $195 to do the same. I&#8217;m reluctant to do this as I&#8217;ve had the unit to Mt Everest, South Pacific, Iceland and many other cool places - I&#8217;m a documentary cinematographer - and I&#8217;ve lost track of which waypoints are backed up on the wife&#8217;s PC.  I think it&#8217;s an outrage that Garmin would 1.) promise full Mac compatibility in 2006 and simply let the matter drop when they failed to deliver, 2.)put purported firmware updates on their site which would, in fact, disable or destroy their devices and 3.) fail to make any attempt to remedy this situation pro-actively with impacted customers.  Fool that I am, I bought a new 60CSx simply becaus
e a handheld GPS is essential to my work.  On the other hand, I&#8217;ll be damned if I&#8217;ll hook the thing up to my Mac any time soon.  In the past I must have sold a couple dozen 60Cs for Garmin simply by bringing it out on shoots.     I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m a little less than enthusiastic to give them any endorsements at this point.  I&#8217;ll give the finger-gymnastics method a try on the old 60C and let you know what comes of it.</p>

<p>Yours in dumb luck and dead reckoning,</p>

<p>SMc</p>

         <p>Bill,</p>

<p>You&#8217;re a life saver!  I had this exact problem and yours is the only site I came across after a few google searches that even mentioned the symptoms.</p>

<p>One note to Keven - it didn&#8217;t work for me at first either.  However, I noticed the screen only flickered for me directly after taking the batteries out and putting them back in, or after plugging in the usb. So I took the batteries out, unplugged usb, then put the batteries back in, plugged in the usb cable and tried the vulcan death grip, and voila - it appeared in the updater app.</p>

<p>Bill - many thanks again!</p>

         <p>My hand is frickin&#8217; killing me, but ya&#8217;ll have saved my 60CSx from being thrown out a window.  Damon&#8217;s hint to take out the batteries and put them back in right before doing this is what finally made it work for me.  Thanks to both of you!</p>

<p>Parallels/WinXP.  The Mac version of the Garmin WebUpdated crashed a number of times.</p>

<p>Garmin makes great GPSr&#8217;s, but they can&#8217;t seem to make software worth a damn.  MapSource is sorry.  Now I&#8217;ve got to figure out how to get the maps loaded - kept failing with the last version of firmware and I&#8217;m hoping this firmware update (3.3) will take care of that.</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>My unit came with version 330 software. I successfully updated it to v. 350. It failed when I aborted a map download, after discovering the maps I was attempting to use was not unlocked for my system.</p>

<p>After reading your solution, I tried several times in vain to perform the fix with the v. 350 software, since it was the latest. Then finally, I gave the v. 330 a try - SUCCESS!!!</p>

         <p>You have not to hold 2 buttons all the time. The service mode turns on when you hold one of the ROKER key, press POWER, and stay to hold ROKER. You may to connect usb then, and start flash.</p>

<p>Garminz used 2 loaders scheme, but it is sometimes has bugs. Software missing may apperar if Bootloader does not find appropriate signature on the firmware flash - for example not success loading. Simply rerun the updater and unit goes on.</p>

         <p>I had problems after deleting waypoints and routes from my CSX. Had to do without it during a cruise from Venice to Rome. Was cursing Garmin all the way. I contacted Garmin in Italy and the very nice guy emailed me back immediately. He said it needed to be reset by hold quit menu and zoom out buttons whilst pressing the power switch. I had to do it a couple of times due to lack of dexterity but sure enough up it comes. No problem. Why don&#8217;t they tell you about these things?</p>

         <p>At last!
After what felt like 296 attempts it worked! I don&#8217;t know what did it, but the last time I tried, I changed the USB-port..   So now the 3.30 edition is well in place.
Thanks a lot for the tip!!</p>

         <p>Tried the above suggestions after webupdater fried my 60csx today. Given the comments about holding down GPS buttons for &#8216;ages&#8217;, I wonder if a serial connection was used by you lucky folk. (I dont own a serial cable (yet)). windows doesnt find a USB device when the GPS is plugged in.</p>

         <p>I will answer my own question..</p>

<p>Yes it was serial communication, yes you can do it with clippy leads if you dont have a garmin serial cable
yes, you fingers get sore after 10 mins - but
YES IT WORKS!!!!</p>

         <p>tried the fix without success.  The updater successfully &#8220;updates&#8221; my 60CSX, but upon completion, the unit powers up to the title screen and after about 3 seconds, fades to nothing.  If you hold down the power button continuously, the title screen remains unchanged but as soon as you release it, the unit fades to nothing.  Any other suggestions from anyone before I take the official Garmin route.  This problem began without having been connected to a computer for some months.  I&#8217;m at a loss since it appears to have come just out of the blue.  Bryan</p>

         <p>Update to last comment.
Ok, put in another SD card then loaded the maps.  Same thing again!  So I put the Garmin 60 CSx in mass media mode then reformatted the SD card.  Now it started up and stays on with the SD card inserted. Reloaded the maps and it works fine now.
Bryan I hope that you read this before you send it in.</p>

         <p>I just wanted to help out anyone who had this problem occur with a Etrex Venture HC. I couldn&#8217;t find anything relating to this problem except for this feed. Basically when updating via the Mac OS X Web Updater, my Venture HC hung on the update and I was forced to unplug it after 30 minutes of waiting. Then it wouldn&#8217;t turn on. Just flickered when I removed and replaced the batteries and pressed the power button. Sounded exactly like the problem people with 60CSX&#8217;s were having. The software is nearly identical between the units. So I pressed and held down the joystick (as you would to select a menu item) and while continuing to hold the joystick button, then I pressed and held down the power button. The screen flickered briefly. Now while I continued to hold these 2 buttons, I clicked the Find Devices button in the Web Updater and low and behold it flippin&#8217; found the device! So while still holding the joystick and power buttons, I clicked t
he update button (or whatever the button said that started the update) and it updated the unit and my Venture HC WORKS!!! Hope this helps others.</p>

         <p>I had problems with my eTrex HC and the Mac web updater hanging on &#8220;loader&#8221;.  The Garmin Mac support in Canada told me that the unit and not the uppdater were at fault.  So I exchanged the unit and same problem occured!  I pressed power and pushed up on rocker key, the Mac uppdater recognized the unit but after three attempts still would hang on loader. I solved the problem by using the above method and getting hold of a Win PC with success, thanks</p>

         <p>Just picked up a Venture HC and used the Mac web updater. It seemed to hang forever on the loader screen. Finally after finding this site I was able to get something loaded. I just let it sit until I saw a black screen with the Garmin logo. Unplugged and pressed power to shut it off, then powered it up, and it was like nothing had ever happened. All my settings are still there, and it acts like it is A-OK. Somebody at Garmin is slacking in their programing department. Might try booting to Win XP and reloading to make sure.</p>

         <p>I hadn&#8217;t used my 60CSx for a couple months now and popped new batteries in. Turned it on and wouldn&#8217;t turn off so I removed the batteries and then was unable to turn it back (tried for over an hour). Tried your tip several times and with different buttons and nothing. Started reading the comments and came across Mathias&#8217;s post. Gave it a good open hand slap on the side and it turned on immediately (should&#8217;ve trusted my gut instinct). Still going to contact Garmin but for now it works good enough. Thanks for the help.</p>

         <p>Thanks so much! It worked on my eTrex Venture HC! It wouldn&#8217;t turn on after a failed firmware update. I was almost ready to pay $100 to get it fixed, and then I found this site!</p>

         <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I had a GPSmap 60Cx that started playing up after the battery went dead. The first symptom was that the maps on the card disappeared then it froze after deleting a waypoint on an active route.
After that I got the welcome screen and it froze there. Only way of switching off was to remove the batteries. I downloaded the Garmin WebUpdater application and upgraded from 3.50 to 3.70 using the on button and up arrow trick. When that had completed doing its thing. I held my breath and tried to switch on but it still froze on the welcome screen. I then tried the &#8216;Master Reset&#8217; (Turn on while holding Page and Enter down).  This brought up the &#8216;Do you wish to delete all user data prompt&#8217; but it froze at that screen (left/right/enter buttons didn&#8217;t do anything. I tried the master reset again but as soon as the &#8216;Do you wish to delete all user data prompt&#8217; screen came up I pressed right arrow and enter really quickly and the reset process completed and then it rebooted as normal and the satellite page appeared making me very happy.  I am not sure if it was the quick button pressing on the master reset or the upgrade from 3.50 to 3.70 t
hat fixed it but I got there in the end.</p>

<p>Thanks to all those who posted on this page.</p>
